As time goes on there will be more ways to support my website. For the time being, the easiest way will be to use the Amazon link to a product (most likely a book) I discuss on my website. Using the link will give me a small commission on your purchase without you incurring any additional costs. 

You can also [click on this **Amazon** link](https://www.amazon.com/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=aleksispaul-20&linkId=2a7e591259f684b84c4b388f79ed09fd&language=en_US) and I'll get 4-7% of whatever you purchase on Amazon in the next 24-hours without you paying anything additional for your purchase.

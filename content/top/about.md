I have a PhD in Educational Psychology and work as a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) Coordinator in a rural district coordinating academic, social/emotional, and behavioral support services, training staff on data-based decision making and the administration and interpretion screening and progress monitoring assessments, and conduct applied research and program evaluation projects. 

This blog is for all of the extra data exploration projects I come up with in my spare time. Most likely it will be heavily focused on education topics, but I also really enjoy reading about and exploring research on running, cycling, weightlifting, nutrition, and general wellness.

I have a PhD in Educational Psychology and work as a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) Coordinator in a rural district. In addition to coordinating academic, social/emotional, and behavioral support services, training staff on data-based decision making and administering screening assessments, I conduct applied research and program evaluation projects. 

This blog is for all of the extra data exploration projects I come up with in my spare time. Most likely it will be heavily focused on education topics, but I also really enjoy reading about and exploring research on running, cycling, weightlifting, nutrition, and general wellness.

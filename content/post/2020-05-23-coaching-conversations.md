Earlier this year I asked a colleague what book they would recommend I read to continue improving my leadership skills. Without a moments hesitation, she pulled [Coaching Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1544319711/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1544319711&linkCode=as2&tag=aleksispaul-20&linkId=703345eabd6a7365f0d9d346f5942bad) off the shelf and told me it was her "go-to" book. I snapped a photo of the book and left it in my Amazon cart for a few months (I hadn't read the book, so I wasn't in as much of a hurry to start it) before I got around to purchasing it.
